# dynamic-traffic-signal-control-dqn
This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based system for optimizing traffic signal control, aimed at improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. The system uses reinforcement learning to make real-time signal timing decisions based on traffic congestion patterns
